To all team members: This repository is to be used as a collaboration tool in order to succesfully produce an amazing Senior Design Project. I want you to know that I hold each of you in the highest regards and look forward to working with you over the next two semesters.

In this repository, you can find all the source code associated with the project as well as some reading material on the various tools that we will be using throughout the project.
